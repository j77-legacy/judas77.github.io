{"name":"About...","tagline":"","body":"Hi, my nickname is judas77. My adventure with customising phone's ROMs began when i bought Samsung Galaxy Ace II (aka Codina). It wasn't my first Android Phone though, the first one was Spica (Samsung Galaxy Lite), the next one - RBM One (one of ZTE Blade variants). When i bought Spica - i installed custom ROM within 24 hours, Blade - it was within 2 hours after i took it home;)). \r\nWhat about Galaxy Ace 2? Hmm... it was quite different.\r\nSome of You remember, that in the end of 2012, there wasn't many alternatives for original Samsung firmware. Beside of it - Samsung stock Gingerbread worked really good.\r\n\r\nBut after Kyrillos13 released his first Codina's custom ROM - i tried it... There were some other custom ROM makers at that time (Robertihnoo [misspelled for sure:)], mkel91, xxxx - i'll figure his name out for sure later;)).\r\n\r\nThen i tried to cook my own custom ROM. My releases of _**Minimal by Judas**_ were warm accepted by community. Last public version (1.6) introduced Aroma Installer and is still downloaded from my dev host;)). _Minimal Gaiden_ (_Minimal Zero_) was my last stock based custom ROM:\r\n>\r\n\"Let's start with few words of explanation. Some time ago, when i was bit tired fighting with AROMA installer configurations (main feature of latest \"Minimal by Judas77 ROMS\"), i decided to go back to the roots of my work: really minimal ROM, where simplicity matters, without additional features. With some tweaks to make it even better. Another reason was connected to releasing another XXMG2 firmware by Samsung: polish firmware - XEO (as you can see here and there - i'm Pole). Differences between MG2 SER (which was base for my latest Minimal by Judas77 ROM) and MG2 XEO (polish) shouldn't bother you at all, unless you are Pole too). Basically - it was much easier for me to do fully debloated - simple ROM than another extended version of AROMA based ROM... But i didn't want to abandon AROMA installer for good, so my next ROM wasn't supposed to be another \"Minimal by Judas77\" version. I named it \"(Minimal) Gaiden\" (which means \"side story\" in japanese), and released it only on some polish android forum. Some day, on that forum, we discussed about system apps, that could be safely removed. One guy finds out, that list available on XDA (Ace 2 subforum) insn't actually available anymore). So i decided to make new, up-to-date list. \"The fruit\" of my work - new list of all system apps from 4.1.2. stock JB firmware was warmly accepted. At that time i was still fighting with init.d support and issues caused by formatting /system BEFORE new ROM installation. After fixing that issues (in unreleased versions of ROMs from \"Gaiden\" tree: N-and-ROM and Minimal-X) - i decided to use abovementioned list to make my \"almost ultimate\" minimal ROM, deleting almost all apps that could be deleted. (I planned to delete all apps that can be replaced using apps from google play in \"ultimate\" version [music player, callendar, video player, etc.] - it could be a pretty good base for customising phone by oneself). And here it is: Minimal ZERO\".\r\n\r\n Yes, that how it was then...\r\nAnd then my adventures with compilations begin.\r\n\r\nSo the story goes..\r\n…1. CM10 – first ROM compiled by me. Without OMX, without camera… Just one build, no copy preserved;\r\n\r\n2. Mokee Open Source 4.2.x – that was my second compiled ROM – most funny thing – there were no compilation errors, but it didn’t boot;\r\n\r\n2. CM10.1 – at that time I used only my versions of CM10.1 ROMs, didn’t even tried “official” Rox’es ones…;\r\n\r\n3. CM10.2 – I think I compiled few versions just after TC’s first releases;\r\n\r\n4. Chameleon OS 4.2 – hmm… that one works quite good, but last release is from “pre-low in-call fix”. Maybe I’ll update that ROM (unless ChaOS Team deleted sources)**\r\n\r\n5. Chameleon OS 4.3 – updated not so long time ago. Work pretty good, but it wasn’t very popular ROM. Maybe I’ll check how it works with MIUI themes).\r\n\r\n6. Mokee Open Source 4.3 – only one build compiled, with OMX patches and low in-call volume fix implemented… That was beautiful ROM on my ZTE Blade (but based on Android 2.3.7), 4.3 version was nothing special (very similar to CM10.2), what was a little disappointment for me. No copy preserved (which is bit strange for me);\r\n\r\n7. Carbon ROM – yes, you can find it in OP, last public ROM from @judas1977 for Ace II?))\r\n\r\n8. Vanilla RootBox – back to 4.2.2 – I updated that ROM after Rox lost his compiling environment, one of the best 4.2.x ROMs… Too bad authors abandoned that project (no 4.3+ sources)…\r\n\r\n9. Slim Bean 4.3 – I had high hopes about that ROM. Pretty fast and stable, with working GPS **, but with broken recovery also (faulty memory access paths, you couldn’t install any zip). I lost some time to fix it, but nothing helped.\r\n\r\n10. Liquid Smooth 4.3 – I compiled that ROM playing with storages and GPS sources**, two or three builds was compiled.\r\n\r\n11. Slim Bean 4.2 - there was Final Fantasies project;)\r\n\r\n12. Resurrection Remix 4.2 - part of abovementioned project.\r\n\r\n13. Carbon KitKat edition - my most loved child\r\n\r\n14. Thinking Bridge 4.4 (nobody needed it;)).\r\n\r\n15. Hmm... something more? Let's see :)\r\n=================","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
